# Breast Cancer Detection
**Course:** Machine Learning (2021)

Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set we predict the outcome of the tumor cells. 
The Cells can be Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (Non-cancerous).

We compare 3 classification models:
1. Decision Trees
2. KNN Classifier
3. Random Forest

### MAIN AGENDA:

Find which model is best suited for prediction of breast cancer by comparing the recall score of the respective models. And deploying the best performing model for Production as a Web App.

### CONCEPTS USED TO BUILD THE PROJECT

- Machine Learning Data Preprocessing
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K- Nearst Neighbours(KNN) Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Machine Learning Visualization Tools
